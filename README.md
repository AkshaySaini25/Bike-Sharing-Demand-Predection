Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 
In this project, we train a model to predict the number of bike rentals at any hour of the year given the weather conditions. The data set was obtained from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. which contained the historical bike usage pattern with weather data spanning two years.

We first build several individual regression models such as Linear, Ridge, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost 
The key takeaway from the EDA and Modeling are

Bike rental count is strongly correlated with the time of the day, with weaker dependence on the temperature and humidity
